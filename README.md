## Installation

2. Install and activate the plugin via CLI:
   ```bash
   bin/console plugin:refresh
   bin/console plugin:install --activate ActOrderSurcharges
   bin/console cache:clear
   ```

## Configuration

1. Go to Admin Panel → Settings → System → Plugins
2. Find "Actualize: Order Surcharges" and click on the three dots
3. Click "Config" to access plugin settings

### Configuration Options

#### Logistic Surcharge

#### Cash on Delivery Fee

- **COD Fee Amount**: Fee amount for cash on delivery payments (default: 5.95 €)

#### Tax Settings

## How it works

### Logistic Surcharge
1. **Automatic Addition**: Added to cart when at least one regular product is present
2. **Cart Cleanup**: Automatically removed when cart becomes empty
3. **Tax Calculation**: Uses appropriate tax rate based on cart contents or configuration

### Cash on Delivery Fee
1. **Payment Detection**: Monitors payment method selection for COD variants
2. **Dynamic Addition**: Fee added when COD payment method is selected
3. **Automatic Removal**: Fee removed when different payment method is chosen
4. **Language Support**: Detects various COD payment method names (Nachnahme, Cash on Delivery, COD)

### Tax Handling
- Inherits tax rate from existing cart products
- Falls back to context tax rules
- Uses configured default tax rate as final fallback
- Proper tax calculation with Shopware's tax system

## Technical Details

- `CheckoutConfirmPageLoadedEvent` - Updates surcharges on checkout page
